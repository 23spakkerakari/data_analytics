# data_analytics
Working on some data analytics projects, and using tools and libs such as pandas, seaborn, streamlit, and heroku


# Overview
In the 'Projs' Folder are all my dataset analyses. These datasets are public compilations used from kaggle
Additionally, in both my projs folder and in the home directory of this repo, you'll find a simple web app I create using streamlit
This repo is always going to be updated to keep coming back =D
